# POC for analysis of data extracted from Indeed

These notebooks belong to a POC (first iteration) to analyze job offers from the site www.indeed.com

Data was extracted using the script [indeed-scrapper](https://github.com/ktxo/indeed-scrapper-demo), 



These notebooks are not: 
- a tutorial, there are many (good and bad) tutorials and books around the world (real world, paper books, teachers;..., virtual world, tutorials, videos...)


# POC

Still working on notebooks...
